Version 11.1.0 
==============

Release date
------------

2 June 2019


Contributors to this release
----------------------------

Jason Harrop


Notable Changes in Version 11.1.0 
---------------------------------

11.1.0 is our first JPMS modularised release, so the jars contain module-info.class entries.

The module names correspond to our Maven modules: 

	org.docx4j.openxml_objects 
	org.docx4j.openxml_objects_pml 
	org.docx4j.openxml_objects_sml 
	
	org.docx4j.core 
	
	org.docx4j.JAXB_MOXy 
	org.docx4j.JAXB_ReferenceImpl 

We require named modules:

    docx4j_xalan_serializer
    docx4j_xalan_interpretive
	org.slf4j
	
(Other dependencies generally aren't JPMS-ready, so they go on the classpath in the "unnamed" module.)	

11.1.0 is compiled with Java 12, targeting Java 11.

jackson-databind dep bumped to 2.9.9.

In other respects this release is the same as v8.1.0, except that docx4j-export-fo 
is temporarily omitted since Maven compiler doesn't like FOP 2.3's avalon dependency.  
When FOP 2.4 is released, we should be able to include it again.



Version 8.1.0 
=============

Release date
------------

21 May 2019

Release date
------------

21 April 2019


Contributors to this release
----------------------------

Jason Harrop


Notable Changes in Version 8.0.0 
---------------------------------

Minimum supported Java version is 8.0

docx4j 8 should be easier to deploy in complex environments such as OSGi, JBoss EAP etc.

docx4j is now a Maven multi-module project.  To use it via Maven, add just one of docx4j-JAXB-Internal, docx4j-JAXB-MOXy,
or docx4j-JAXB-ReferenceImpl dependencies. 

Various dependencies were updated (some of which require Java 1.8)

OpenDoPE support for XPath 2.0, 3.0 (requires Saxon)

Uses repackaged and mavenized Xalan; see https://github.com/plutext/xalan-j/tree/Plutext_Java8_Repackaged_Docx4j

Version 6.1.1 
=============

Release date
------------

21 January 2019


Contributors to this release
----------------------------

Jason Harrop


Notable Changes in Version 6.1.1 
---------------------------------

vml and mc lists are now of type ArrayListVml|Mce respecitvely, in which parent object is automatically set correctly
(as is done for wml objects)

TraversalUtil replaceChildren: support replacing in a bare List object.

OpenDoPE removal handler: new option ALL_BUT_PLACEHOLDERS_CONTENT, 
Ordinarily, if an SDT contains XML but no real content, that XML is also removed.  
Choose this option if you want to keep placeholder XML (but remove the SDT).



Version 6.1.0

Notable Changes in Version 6.1.0 
---------------------------------

IMPORTANT: Force namespaces used in mc:choice to be declared top-level. If 
they aren't there, Word can't open the docx.

mc:Ignorable: support attribute in footnotes/endnotes, numbering, styles 
(already supported in main and headers/footers) 

w14 namespace handling improvements: Don't drop these attributes in mc-preprocessor.xslt; 
Support w14:EG_RPrOpenType elements

PDF Converter now defaults to localhost endpoint to avoid information leakage.
(controlled by docx4j property com.plutext.converter.URL)
The localhost endpoint will only work if you download and install the converter there! 
If you choose to use converter-eval.plutext.com, please only use it for light testing purposes.

BookmarksIntegrity checking now part of docx4j proper; used before ToC updating

AttachTemplate now part of docx4j proper; method cloneAs

OpenDoPE finisher: optional step in which formatting can be applied
(this is often neater than using conditional content controls just for formatting)

OpenDoPE RemovalHandler: new Quantifier.ALL_BUT_PLACEHOLDERS (ie remove content controls, 
but keep any placeholders inserted where there is empty content), ability to specify 
Quantifier via docx4j.properties; also ability to substitute your own RemovalHandler.xslt.

OpenDoPE: simplified component processing model [requires Enterprise]:
 1. components don't have to be at the top paragraph level of the content tree,
 BUT:
 2. component processing is now done before condition/repeat processing
 3. component processing is not recursive anymore
 4. components typically use the "main" answer file
component processing is OFF by default
Enable it with property "docx4j.model.datastorage.OpenDoPEHandlerComponents.enabled"

- Maven profiles for java 9 and 10

Preserve mc:AlternateContent in a run. Previously, this would have caused mc-preprocessor 
to be invoked, selecting one of the pieces of content.

Object model for wps http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/word/2010/wordprocessingShape

Content Control databinding (and OpenDoPE)
- UpdateXmlFromDocumentSurface: Copy content control content back to the custom XML part, like Microsoft Word does for a content control
 which has a w:databinding element
- improvements to migration (from eg VariableReplace)
- better support for binding standardised Answers format
- various other improvement

Write docx4j version as XML comment in MainDocument part.

New properties docx4j.openpackaging.parts.MAX_BYTES.unzip.error and docx4j.openpackaging.parts.MAX_BYTES.unmarshal.error which can be 
set to positive values to have docx4j throw a PartTooLarge exception 
if a part is larger than the set value.

Version 3.3.1  minor release
=============

Release date
------------

16 August 2016


Contributors to this release
----------------------------

https://github.com/ai-github

Jason Harrop


Notable Changes in Version 3.3.1
---------------------------------

Contents lists are now of type ArrayListWml, in which parent is automatically set correctly

org.docx4j.anon: new package which converts a docx to lorem ipsum latin, and removes
other sensitive info, so the docx can safely be shared eg for tech support.  
For this to work, you'll need to add a new dependency: http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Ccom.thedeanda%7Clorem%7C2.0%7Cjar
 
OpenDoPE: Two separate performance optimizations which substantially speed up large XML binding jobs.  By traversing the XML data, manually calculate and cache XPaths (tested with 500,000 entries).  Our strategy is to try the cache first (if enabled), then if there is a cache miss, use org.apache.xpath.CachedXPathAPI (the second optimization - CachedXPathAPI  is quicker than default javax.xml.xpath.XPath implementations)

Dedicated parts for w15 CommentsExtended and People

Support anchor attributes wp14:anchorId and wp14:editId; children wp14:sizeRelH, wp14:sizeRelV

Support w:bdo and w:dir from ECMA 376 4ed

workaround for MOXy issue triggering pre-processing from binder: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37225221/moxy-validationevents-triggered-by-unmarshaller-but-not-binder

JAXB event handler: make shouldContinue false by default, mc Content pre-processing works in MOXy (for unmarshalling anyway, as distinct from binder)

unmarshall input stream: do mc pre-processing if necessary

New property docx4j.jaxb.marshal.canonicalize:
Whether to canonicalize during marshalling (defaults to false);
this is for aesthetic purposes: the Sun/Oracle JAXB reference implementation
writes a lot of unnecessary namespaces (each one in the JAXB context?).


Dependency Changes
------------------

Added com.thedeanda:lorem:jar:2.0; only required if you want to use org.docx4j.anon (see above)

Notable Changes - PDF
---------------------

XSL FO based PDF output moved to new/separate project docx4j-export-fo; default PDF converter 
changed from XSL FO + Apache FOP to Plutext's PDF Converter. The instance at
converter-eval.plutext.com is used by default, but you can (and should!) alter it to your own
instance, by setting docx4j property, eg:

com.plutext.converter.URL=http://converter-eval.plutext.com:80/v1/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/convert

See further http://www.plutext.com/m/index.php/products-docx-to-pdf.html

If you want to use the existing XSL FO + Apache FOP PDF Conversion, just add docx4j-export-fo (+ deps) to your classpath.  These jars are in the zip file, in dir optional/export-fo  docx4j will detect that they are present, and revert to the FO based conversion.

Notable Changes - Other
-----------------------

Document protection (read only, track revisions etc) for docx/pptx/xlsx, with or without password. 
NB: Digital signature support is in Enterprise Ed. 
See further https://github.com/plutext/docx4j/blob/VERSION_3_3_0/src/main/java/org/docx4j/openpackaging/packages/ProtectionSettings.java and ProtectDocument.java

docx table of contents (TOC) generation and update migrated from Enterpise Ed.  See org.docx4j.toc and the Toc* samples. The layout model in Plutext's PDF Converter (see above) will be used to calculate page numbers, unless docx4j-export-fo (+ deps) is on your path

Workaround for JAXB behaviour change (for recent releases of JAXB, mcPreprocessor only worked the first 10 times);
see/subscribe to https://github.com/gf-metro/jaxb/issues/22

Xalan <= 2.7.2 can't handle astral characters: see/vote for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XALANJ-2419
So:
(i)  workaround this when serializing XML
(ii) optionally workaround this when we use Xalan for XSLT, controlled by docx4j.properties docx4j.xalan.XALANJ-2419.workaround=true|false
[Comment: When will Xalan make a release which fixes this issue? This code will be removed if they do.]

RunFontSelector: basic support for Unicode astral characters

Performance improvement: property docx4j.openpackaging.parts.JaxbXmlPartXPathAware.binder.eager.* allows us to avoid unmarshalling via DOM

Handle McIgnorableNamespaces within NamespacePrefixMapper classes

XJC generated code for word/2010/wordprocessingDrawing

Repackage portions of org.apache.poi (mainly poifs) as org.docx4j.org.apache.poi
(and remove dependency on poi-scratchpad; remove Doc import since poi.hwpf dep is now absent)

Repackage santuario c14n (org.apache.xml.security) as org.docx4j.org.apache.xml.security. 
[Comment: Useful for c14n, but not essential to docx4j, so may yet be removed. Opinions welcome]

Avoid adding virtual styles to docx representing DocDefaults; this is now internal to StyleTree



Dependency Changes (relative to 3.2.x)
------------------

Removed: jaxb-xmldsig-core, poi-scratchpad, commons-lang

Added: 

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
			<artifactId>commons-lang3</artifactId>
			<version>3.4</version>
		</dependency>

Moved FOP/batik jars to separate project docx4j-export-fo

3a2128e - Workaround for org.apache.fop.fo.ValidationException: "fo:flow" is missing child elements.

Notable Changes in Version 2.7.1
---------------------------------

Preparation for including docx4j in Maven Central

[1605-1610] mc:AlternateContent preprocessor, allowing graceful degradation of Word 2010 specific content

[1604] docx4j.properties, supports configuration of default page size, margins, orientation; also ability to set some of the doc props metadata (Application & AppVersion; dc.creator & dc.lastModifiedBy).

[1631, 1637] HtmlExporterNG2,(Pdf)Conversion, SvgExporter: storing any images is delegated to a
ConversionImageHandler that may be passed as a conversion parameter. Default implementation: DefaultConversionImageHandler

VFS stuff moved to docx4j-extras

OpenDoPE changes
----------------

[1639] Change static OpenDoPEHandler design to instance-based design, with objective of making it thread-safe.

[1645] When binding, create hyperlinks out of text containing http://

[1653] Handle unwrapping correctly in ShallowTraversor, so JAXBElements stay wrapped, and we don't risk a marshalling exception for any which don't have an @XmlRootElement annotation.

[1658] Word can only resolve an XPath binding which results in an element (as opposed to a boolean, integer, string or node-set). OpenDoPE processing can handle these other results types (some of them anyway).
Up until now, that processing was done in OpenDoPEHandler. Now it is done in BindingHandler and bind.xslt, for consistency with how normal Word XPath bindings are handled by docx4j.

[1662] Bind picture correctly where parent is another content control.

Other Changes (non-exhaustive)
------------------------------

[1613] Header and footer parts use XPath binder

[1679-80] create image part directly from file

Notable Changes in Version 2.7.0
---------------------------------

Improvements to Maven build

ContentAccessor interface

AlteredParts: identify parts in this pkg which are new or altered; Patcher 
which adds new or altered parts.

Support for .glox SmartArt package (/src/glox/) 

JAXB RI 2.2.3 compatibilty

OpenDoPE improvements (see below) 

xlsx4j
------

[1455] Support for Spreadsheet Comments.

[1494] Detect /xl/workbook.xml as WorkbookPart, rather than DefaultXmlPart.  
Add convenience method getWorkbookPart

pptx4j
------

[1539] Better support for slide size.

[1549] Convenience method to get MainPresentationPart

OpenDoPE changes
----------------

[1339] OpenDoPEHandler: Pre-processing step evaluates an od:xpath which doesn't have a corresponding w:databinding.  
This is designed to handle an XPath expression which evaluates to a boolean or number, rather than a node.

[1389] Generalise applyBindings, so that it should work on not just a DocumentPart, but also a header or footer part.

[1390] Act on databinding for content controls of type picture.

[1423] Support w:multiLine data binding.

[1441] scale image based on content control size

[1449] Handle a databinding which points to Core or Extended Properties, or CoverPage props.

[1453] Traverse into text box.  Handle content control in text box.  

[1506] Process Header and Footer parts as well.

[1547] Tinne's patch of 20 June, which takes the Jan-Willem van den Broeks XPath grammar and builds it into a rewriting parser that enhances xpath expressions just the way that is needed. Thus, all xpath 1.0 expressions can be used.

Other Changes (non-exhaustive)
------------------------------

Various PDF & HTML output improvements

Tuning of log levels; removal of some System.out.println

[1333] Fix for image part naming.

[1344] UnitsOfMeasurement, fix for Germany, where they use a comma as decimal separator instead of a point.  Solves issue in FOP

[1352] Rework header/footer model to take account of "same as previous" and whether first page header/footer is active or not.

[1356] Code cleanup: remove old approaches to HTML generation.

[1358] Allow for user-defined handlers to prepare HTML output depending on the value of an sdt tag.

[1396] docx4j is not dependent on Xerces (other than in XmlPart), but Websphere (presumably using IBM JDK) doesn't have Sun's Xerces implementation, so use real Xerces if it is on the class path

[1412] Add XPath support to header part.

[1416] coarser grained ways to tokenize text when
diffx turns XML into a stream of events. The current diffx stuff creates
a token for every word, and on large documents, the diff algorithms become
unwieldy in terms of memory usage/time. Coarser text splitting makes fewer
events.

[1432] interface to getSdtPr
[1437] SdtElement interface; CTCustomXmlElement interface

[1461] VML generated classes, based on ECMA 376 1ed (rather than earlier draft).  

[1470] Make docx4j compatible with JAXB RI 2.2.3 unmarshalling

[1479] extension to TraversalUtil, which allows you to define the tag you are interested in as a generic of the visitor class.

[1480] StyleUtil: styles areEqual, isEmpty, apply

[1481] Bugfix: Handle internal HYPERLINK 

[1487] MetafilePart to extend BPAI, so WMF images can be added.

[1492] Support for http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/bibliography

[1536] Support for common paper sizes.

[1537] Knowledge of "well known" margin settings.

[1556] Native support for bitmap (bmp) images

[1569] Configure log4j automatically if necessary; paves the way for all System.out.println to be removed.

[1238] Use standard Xalan 2.7.1 instead of our patched version; remove references to DTMNodeProxy
[1262] Use style0 as default para style for docx from OO
[1270] Support full justification in XSL FO
[1273] HTML output: when test="contains(./w:sdtPr/w:tag/@w:val, '@class=collapse')" allow the sdt to Collapse.
[1295] Methods to check whether partname is already in use.
[1302] Pass Relationship to newPartForContentType so AlternativeFormatInputPart can be detected.
[1306] EmbeddedPackagePart
[1307] OpcPackage: don't create props parts, merely because user has asked for one. CorePart: set JAXB context correctly. Rels part: relId generation altered

pptx4j changes
--------------

[1179] Basic support for images in pptx svg in html output
[1180] Alter slide to html/svg api, to make it more obvious you are processing a slide, and doing so one at a time.
Only show text box with a red dash border if debug level logging is enabled.
[1185] Support Word 2003 page numbers in PDF output. ie <w:fldChar w:fldCharType="begin"/> <w:instrText xml:space="preserve">PAGE  </w:instrText>

=============

Release date

Holger Schlegel

Major Changes in Version 2.2.2
------------------------------

[888] Generate classes from shared-math.xsd

[885] JAXB representation for VML (eg as used when a document containing embedded images is 
      saved as docx from Word 2003).      

Other Changes
-------------

[895] There are no dom4j parts anymore.  Parts which aren't JAXB XML parts now extend new XmlPart, 
      which uses JAXP instead of dom4j.  The use of dom4j is deprecated, and all references to it
      will be removed in docx4j v3.

[894] Explicitly specify class loader when loading JAXBContext. Prevents versions of JBOSS from
      trying to use a different class loader.
      
[893] Replace deepCopy methods with Holger's contribution of 9 Sept.

[887] Apply Holger Schlegel's patch adding a generic parameter for the JaxbElement property.      

[886] SaveToJCR will create folders from path segments as required (at least for Alfresco; 
      for other implementations, TODO ensure '/' is not encoded!)  
      
[883] NamespacePrefixMappings stores the mappings in a single location, and is sufficient for xpath.      

Version 2.2.1
=============

Adam Schmideg

Major Changes
-------------

[869] NamespacePrefixMappers which work with Java 6 (ie if you don't have JAXB in your endorsed dir, 
      or can't (eg Java Web Start)).  

Other Changes (not exhaustive)
-------------

[871] Get rid of System.out.println (mostly).

[870] Avoid returning null DocumentFragment from getNumberXmlNode extension, since this causes 
      Xalan to produce a stack trace
      
[867] Use Java's xerces.internal instead of Crimson in CustomXmlDataStorageImpl  

[865] Don't get value of attributes when passing table contents to Converter.toNode; 
      Attributes on <w:tr w:rsidR="00E54D1F" w:rsidRPr="00A84EA1"> screws output.

[864] ImmutablePropertyResolver, contributed by Adam Schmideg.

Major Changes
-------------

CustomXml applyBindings works (to proof of concept level)

Differencing improvements

Table model and Converter interface.  Use of this table model in HtmlExporterNG, 
to support merged cells. Contributed by Adam Schmideg. 

New class PropertyResolver [757], which works out the actual properties which apply to a paragraph or a run.

Header/footer support 

PDF via XSL FO or iText (in addition to existing support for via HTML)

"Next Generation" HTML Exporter, which only needs the main document part as input, and 
which takes advantage of docx4j's knowledge of the document (via extension functions) 
so that most of the logic is done in Java (as opposed to xslt).

Improvements to font handling/substitution (inc auto-detect option)

Image insertion convenience methods

Other Changes (not exhaustive)
-------------

[856] Start of work on NamespacePrefixMappers which work with Java 6 (ie if you don't have JAXB 
      in your endorsed dir, or can't (eg Java Web Start)). [Not finished until v2.2.1!]

[854] Remove ContentTypeManager interface; replace it with implementation.
      ContentTypeManager: change semantics of isContentTypeRegistered, so that it means 
      'is *default* content type registered'.
      
[847] Relativise file URLs for images, based on contribution by Leigh;
      Only relativise path if its not the tmpdir, because the tmp dir is used for pdf output      

[841] Updated createImgE10 extension function to point to class org.docx4j.model.images.WordXmlPicture.

[650] Convenience method to restart numbering

      so that the image can be added to eg a header.
      
[625] Add an HtmlSetting 'conditionalComments' which defaults to turning these off in the style sheet, 
      since FlyingSaucer PDF Renderer renders <![if!supportMisalignedColumns]><![endif]> verbatim, and there 
      have been reports of Xerces SAX parser not liking these:

[607] Make it easy for a part to have its own NamespacePrefixMapper. (eg for relationships part,
