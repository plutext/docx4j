Notable Changes in Version 2.7.1
---------------------------------

Preparation for including docx4j in Maven Central

[1605-1610] mc:AlternateContent preprocessor, allowing graceful degradation of Word 2010 specific content

[1604] docx4j.properties, supports configuration of default page size, margins, orientation; also ability to set some of the doc props metadata (Application & AppVersion; dc.creator & dc.lastModifiedBy).

[1631, 1637] HtmlExporterNG2,(Pdf)Conversion, SvgExporter: storing any images is delegated to a
ConversionImageHandler that may be passed as a conversion parameter. Default implementation: DefaultConversionImageHandler

VFS stuff moved to docx4j-extras

OpenDoPE changes
----------------

[1639] Change static OpenDoPEHandler design to instance-based design, with objective of making it thread-safe.

[1645] When binding, create hyperlinks out of text containing http://

[1653] Handle unwrapping correctly in ShallowTraversor, so JAXBElements stay wrapped, and we don't risk a marshalling exception for any which don't have an @XmlRootElement annotation.

[1658] Word can only resolve an XPath binding which results in an element (as opposed to a boolean, integer, string or node-set). OpenDoPE processing can handle these other results types (some of them anyway).
Up until now, that processing was done in OpenDoPEHandler. Now it is done in BindingHandler and bind.xslt, for consistency with how normal Word XPath bindings are handled by docx4j.

[1662] Bind picture correctly where parent is another content control.

Other Changes (non-exhaustive)
------------------------------

[1613] Header and footer parts use XPath binder

[1679-80] create image part directly from file

Notable Changes in Version 2.7.0
---------------------------------

Improvements to Maven build

ContentAccessor interface

AlteredParts: identify parts in this pkg which are new or altered; Patcher 
which adds new or altered parts.

Support for .glox SmartArt package (/src/glox/) 

JAXB RI 2.2.3 compatibilty

OpenDoPE improvements (see below) 

xlsx4j
------

[1455] Support for Spreadsheet Comments.

[1494] Detect /xl/workbook.xml as WorkbookPart, rather than DefaultXmlPart.  
Add convenience method getWorkbookPart

pptx4j
------

[1539] Better support for slide size.

[1549] Convenience method to get MainPresentationPart

OpenDoPE changes
----------------

[1339] OpenDoPEHandler: Pre-processing step evaluates an od:xpath which doesn't have a corresponding w:databinding.  
This is designed to handle an XPath expression which evaluates to a boolean or number, rather than a node.

[1389] Generalise applyBindings, so that it should work on not just a DocumentPart, but also a header or footer part.

[1390] Act on databinding for content controls of type picture.

[1423] Support w:multiLine data binding.

[1441] scale image based on content control size

[1449] Handle a databinding which points to Core or Extended Properties, or CoverPage props.

[1453] Traverse into text box.  Handle content control in text box.  

[1506] Process Header and Footer parts as well.

[1547] Tinne's patch of 20 June, which takes the Jan-Willem van den Broeks XPath grammar and builds it into a rewriting parser that enhances xpath expressions just the way that is needed. Thus, all xpath 1.0 expressions can be used.

Other Changes (non-exhaustive)
------------------------------

Various PDF & HTML output improvements

Tuning of log levels; removal of some System.out.println

[1333] Fix for image part naming.

[1344] UnitsOfMeasurement, fix for Germany, where they use a comma as decimal separator instead of a point.  Solves issue in FOP

[1352] Rework header/footer model to take account of "same as previous" and whether first page header/footer is active or not.

[1356] Code cleanup: remove old approaches to HTML generation.

[1358] Allow for user-defined handlers to prepare HTML output depending on the value of an sdt tag.

[1396] docx4j is not dependent on Xerces (other than in XmlPart), but Websphere (presumably using IBM JDK) doesn't have Sun's Xerces implementation, so use real Xerces if it is on the class path

[1412] Add XPath support to header part.

[1416] coarser grained ways to tokenize text when
diffx turns XML into a stream of events. The current diffx stuff creates
a token for every word, and on large documents, the diff algorithms become
unwieldy in terms of memory usage/time. Coarser text splitting makes fewer
events.

[1432] interface to getSdtPr
[1437] SdtElement interface; CTCustomXmlElement interface

[1461] VML generated classes, based on ECMA 376 1ed (rather than earlier draft).  

[1470] Make docx4j compatible with JAXB RI 2.2.3 unmarshalling

[1479] extension to TraversalUtil, which allows you to define the tag you are interested in as a generic of the visitor class.

[1480] StyleUtil: styles areEqual, isEmpty, apply

[1481] Bugfix: Handle internal HYPERLINK 

[1487] MetafilePart to extend BPAI, so WMF images can be added.

[1492] Support for http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/bibliography

[1536] Support for common paper sizes.

[1537] Knowledge of "well known" margin settings.

[1556] Native support for bitmap (bmp) images

[1569] Configure log4j automatically if necessary; paves the way for all System.out.println to be removed.

------------------------------

OpenDoPE ("Open Document Processing Ecosystem") v2.2 implementation for generating documents using repeats, conditionals and component inclusion.
Implementation now lives in model/datastorage package.

TraversalUtil class, which makes it easy to find things in the main document part (an alternative to XPath), and optionally, do something to them

[1238] Use standard Xalan 2.7.1 instead of our patched version; remove references to DTMNodeProxy
[1262] Use style0 as default para style for docx from OO
[1270] Support full justification in XSL FO
[1273] HTML output: when test="contains(./w:sdtPr/w:tag/@w:val, '@class=collapse')" allow the sdt to Collapse.
[1295] Methods to check whether partname is already in use.
[1302] Pass Relationship to newPartForContentType so AlternativeFormatInputPart can be detected.
[1306] EmbeddedPackagePart
[1307] OpcPackage: don't create props parts, merely because user has asked for one. CorePart: set JAXB context correctly. Rels part: relId generation altered

pptx4j changes
--------------

[1179] Basic support for images in pptx svg in html output
[1180] Alter slide to html/svg api, to make it more obvious you are processing a slide, and doing so one at a time.
Only show text box with a red dash border if debug level logging is enabled.
[1185] Support Word 2003 page numbers in PDF output. ie <w:fldChar w:fldCharType="begin"/> <w:instrText xml:space="preserve">PAGE  </w:instrText>

Version 2.2.2
=============

Release date
------------

17 Sept 2009

Jason Harrop
Holger Schlegel

Major Changes in Version 2.2.2
------------------------------

[888] Generate classes from shared-math.xsd

[885] JAXB representation for VML (eg as used when a document containing embedded images is 
      saved as docx from Word 2003).      

Other Changes
-------------

[895] There are no dom4j parts anymore.  Parts which aren't JAXB XML parts now extend new XmlPart, 
      which uses JAXP instead of dom4j.  The use of dom4j is deprecated, and all references to it
      will be removed in docx4j v3.

[894] Explicitly specify class loader when loading JAXBContext. Prevents versions of JBOSS from
      trying to use a different class loader.
      
[893] Replace deepCopy methods with Holger's contribution of 9 Sept.

[887] Apply Holger Schlegel's patch adding a generic parameter for the JaxbElement property.      

[886] SaveToJCR will create folders from path segments as required (at least for Alfresco; 
      for other implementations, TODO ensure '/' is not encoded!)  
      
[883] NamespacePrefixMappings stores the mappings in a single location, and is sufficient for xpath.      

Version 2.2.1
=============

Release date
------------

24 Aug 2009

Contributors to this release
----------------------------

Jason Harrop
Adam Schmideg

Major Changes
-------------

[869] NamespacePrefixMappers which work with Java 6 (ie if you don't have JAXB in your endorsed dir, 
      or can't (eg Java Web Start)).  

Other Changes (not exhaustive)
-------------

[871] Get rid of System.out.println (mostly).

[870] Avoid returning null DocumentFragment from getNumberXmlNode extension, since this causes 
      Xalan to produce a stack trace
      
[867] Use Java's xerces.internal instead of Crimson in CustomXmlDataStorageImpl  

[865] Don't get value of attributes when passing table contents to Converter.toNode; 
      Attributes on <w:tr w:rsidR="00E54D1F" w:rsidRPr="00A84EA1"> screws output.

[864] ImmutablePropertyResolver, contributed by Adam Schmideg.

Major Changes
-------------

CustomXml applyBindings works (to proof of concept level)

Differencing improvements

Table model and Converter interface.  Use of this table model in HtmlExporterNG, 
to support merged cells. Contributed by Adam Schmideg. 

New class PropertyResolver [757], which works out the actual properties which apply to a paragraph or a run.

Header/footer support 

PDF via XSL FO or iText (in addition to existing support for via HTML)

"Next Generation" HTML Exporter, which only needs the main document part as input, and 
which takes advantage of docx4j's knowledge of the document (via extension functions) 
so that most of the logic is done in Java (as opposed to xslt).

Improvements to font handling/substitution (inc auto-detect option)

Image insertion convenience methods

Other Changes (not exhaustive)
-------------

[856] Start of work on NamespacePrefixMappers which work with Java 6 (ie if you don't have JAXB 
      in your endorsed dir, or can't (eg Java Web Start)). [Not finished until v2.2.1!]

[854] Remove ContentTypeManager interface; replace it with implementation.
      ContentTypeManager: change semantics of isContentTypeRegistered, so that it means 
      'is *default* content type registered'.
      
[847] Relativise file URLs for images, based on contribution by Leigh;
      Only relativise path if its not the tmpdir, because the tmp dir is used for pdf output      

[841] Updated createImgE10 extension function to point to class org.docx4j.model.images.WordXmlPicture.  
      Reported and fix suggested by Leigh
      
[816] Bug fix: Close image files properly; patch contributed by Serge Grachov

[815] Store/retrieve key/value pairs in sdtPr/tag

[808] Text extraction

[799] If no directory for saving images is specified, embed the image using a data: URI

[784] LoadFromZipFileNG, suports reading from an input stream

[776] Renamed package out.xmlPackage to out.FlatOpcXml
      Renamed XmlPackageCreator to FlatOpcXmlCreator
      
[771] Renamed XmlPackageImporter to FlatOpcXmlImporter

[697] Remove fop-fonts; to be replaced with a complete fop jar

[650] Convenience method to restart numbering

[633] Add a createImagePart signature which allows you to specify the source part of the image part's rel, 
      so that the image can be added to eg a header.
      
[625] Add an HtmlSetting 'conditionalComments' which defaults to turning these off in the style sheet, 
      since FlyingSaucer PDF Renderer renders <![if!supportMisalignedColumns]><![endif]> verbatim, and there 
      have been reports of Xerces SAX parser not liking these:

[607] Make it easy for a part to have its own NamespacePrefixMapper. (eg for relationships part, 
      we want the rels namespace to be the default namespace)

Other Changes (not exhaustive)
-------------

[563] Specialised parts for some image types (rather than just treating them as BinaryPart).

[560] Create <img> element for E2.0 images

[559] Basic support for resolving a hyperlink by reference to the rels part, using an XSLT 
      extension function.
      
[558] Use docx 2 html XSLT from OpenXMLViewer.     

[547] getParts() method contributed by Manimala Kumar
