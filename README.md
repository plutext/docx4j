What is docx4j?

It uses JAXB to create the Java representation.

- Create new docx/pptx/xlsx 
- Programmatically manipulate docx/pptx/xlsx (anything the file format allows)
- CustomXML binding (with support for pictures, rich text, checkboxes, and OpenDoPE extensions for repeats & conditionals, and importing XHTML) 
- Export as HTML or PDF
- Produce/consume Word 2007's xmlPackage (pkg) format
- Apply transforms, including common filters
- Font support (font substitution, and use of any fonts embedded in the document)
