Start up the Git Bash session and go to your project directory.

Windows users, you need to start up an SSH agent to provide your passkey when needed by the release process.

To do this, in your Git Shell type :
    1eval `ssh-agent`  //pay attention to the back tick quotes here
which should return a piece of text like Agent pid xyz. This command starts the agent and sets up a couple of 
environment variables relating to the SSH agent. If you type env | grep SSH you will see the environment variables :
   1$ env | grep SSH
   2SSH_AGENT_PID=1234
   3SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-abcdef1234/agent.5678

Windows users will need to manually create the directory c:/tmp/ssh-abcdef1234/agent.5678 otherwise you
get and error saying could not open a connection to your authentication agent.

Create the new directory and then add your key to the agent using the following syntax which assumes your 
Github RSA key is in the c:\.ssh\ directory. If it isnâ€™t then just substitute the directory for your key.

   1$ssh-add "/c/.ssh/id_rsa"

then per https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide

mvn release:clean

mvn release:prepare

mvn release:perform

perform breaks (1) because target/generated-sources is already under version control (why? get rid of this)

so have to mv target out of the way, svn update, then copy current contents into it

perform breaks (2) because it run in wrong dir, so cd target/checkout/docx4j and manually run it:

$ mvn deploy --no-plugin-updates -Psonatype-oss-release -f pom.xml

(This runs on the branch you've created in previous steps. All the previous steps do is create that branch, and change trunk's pom to whatever next version will be)

Uploading: https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2//org/docx4j/docx4j/2.7.1/docx4j-2.7.1.jar
5691K uploaded  (docx4j-2.7.1.jar)

Then release it:

1. close the staging repository:

   1. Login to the Nexus UI, https://oss.sonatype.org/index.html#welcome
   2. Go to Staging Repositories page.
   3. Select a staging repository.
   4. Click the Close button.

2. when you are sure the closed staging repository has no problem, click the Release button.

--------

The mvn generated jar is currently bigger (5.6MB), because it contains unnecessary docx.

TODO: fix this
