/**
 * Wraps a <tt>byte</tt> array and provides simple data input access.
 * Internally, this class maintains a buffer read index, so that for the most part, primitive
 * data can be read in a data-input-stream-like manner.<p/>
 *
 * Note - the calling class should call the {@link #available()} method to detect end-of-buffer
 * and move to the next data block when the current is exhausted.
 * For optimisation reasons, no error handling is performed in this class.  Thus, mistakes in
 * calling code ran may raise ugly exceptions here, like {@link ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException},
 * etc .<p/>
 *
 * The multi-byte primitive input methods ({@link #readUShortLE()}, {@link #readIntLE()} and
 * {@link #readLongLE()}) have corresponding 'spanning read' methods which (when required) perform
 * a read across the block boundary.  These spanning read methods take the previous
 * {@link DataInputBlock} as a parameter.
 * Reads of larger amounts of data (into <tt>byte</tt> array buffers) must be managed by the caller
 * since these could conceivably involve more than two blocks.
 *
