Unless you are using Maven, these samples all require:
- the Documents4j local jar files and the docx4j-documents4j-local jar (provided in this zip)
- docx4j and its deps (provided in the separate community zip)
- unless you are using a Java which ships with JAXB, the one of docx4j-JAXB-ReferenceImpl|MOXy

If you are using Maven, just use the pom provided.

Then you should be able to run one of the samples in the src dir.
