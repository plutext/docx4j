Export control statement

docx4j is primarily developed in Australia, so its exported from Australia.  Because of this, the Australian export control laws apply.

docx4j uses poifs.crypt to handle password protected documents, but docx4j is open source, and, per https://www.defence.gov.au/exportcontrols/ICT.asp

```
"Any open source software or technology is automatically exempt from any DSGL control based on the definition of "in the public domain", which is:

"Technology" or "software" which has been made available without restrictions upon its further dissemination (copyright restrictions do not remove "technology" or "software" from being "in the public domain").
```

Docx4j Enterprise contains a digital signature component, but digital signatures are specifically excluded from the meaning of "cryptography for data confidentiality"
